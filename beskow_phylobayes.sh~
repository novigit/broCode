=head1 NAME

beskow_phylobayes.sh - Run one phylobayes chain on Beskow

=head1 USAGE

beskow_phylobayes.sh <phylip> <model> <chain> <mode>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is called by the script beskow_submit_phylobayes.sh. 

It tells Beskow to run one phylobayes chain on the alignment <phylip> with the model <model>, for <hours> hours

It has two modes: start and continue. Start initates the chain, while continue continues a chain.

Currently hard-coded to running 128 cores per chain, for 23 hours and 50 minutes

=head1 NOTE

This script should be used only on Beskow, because its large CPU power.
